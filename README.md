# medical_cost_prediction
Human life is clearly bounded with medical industry. As the medical costs are rising nowadays, predicting such 
costs accurately is a remarkable initial step in addressing this problem. A machine learning model is built to 
predict personal medical cost of a beneficiary which could be used by an insurance company to make their own 
profit.

Linear Regression with multiple variables is used here which is a supervised learning technique. Supervised 
learning is selected since the dataset is given with classes/ labels for each instance of the dataset.

The dataset is attached herewith. It consists of seven columns in total. They are age, sex, BMI, children, smoker, 
region and charges.

What can we conclude using the model? 
• As per to the pie chart generated, male has higher medical charges than female. 
• As the per to the generated heatmap, attribute ‘smoke’ has the higher correlation. So, it could be argued that people who smokes tobacco have higher chances to get a higher medical charge.
